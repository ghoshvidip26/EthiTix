## 💡 The Problem

Traditional event ticketing is plagued with issues that frustrate both organizers and attendees. Organizers face:

- **❌ Black Market Sales:** Rampant black ticket selling and unauthorized resales inflate prices and create unfair access, as seen in major events like the Ahmedabad Coldplay concert.
- **❌ Fraud & Forgery:** Fake registrations, counterfeit tickets, and identity fraud lead to security risks and revenue loss.
- **❌ Lack of Transparency:** There is no verifiable, on-chain proof of participation, making records difficult to audit and trust.
- **❌ Disconnected Systems:** Organizers often juggle multiple, disconnected tools for managing registrations, verifying participants, and granting access.

## ✨ Our Solution: EthiTix

**EthiTix** is a seamless, secure, and transparent solution that leverages the power of the Aptos blockchain to revolutionize event management.

Our platform prevents black marketing by issuing wallet-bound, QR-based tickets that provide verifiable, on-chain proof of access. We streamline the entire event lifecycle—from creation and registration to approval and check-in—all within a single, decentralized application.

- ✅ **On-Chain Verification:** Participant approvals are transparently recorded on Aptos, creating an immutable and verifiable ledger.
- ✅ **Ethical Ticketing:** Fair and rule-based ticketing ensures no scalping or unfair resales. All rules are enforced by smart contracts.
- ✅ **QR-Powered Access:** Soulbound (non-transferable) QR codes are tied directly to an attendee's wallet, making them easy to scan and impossible to fake.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Wallet-Based Identity:** Users register with their Aptos wallet, creating a secure and unique digital identity for event participation.
- **Admin Control Panel:** Event organizers can effortlessly create new events, set participation limits, and manage all event details.
- **On-Chain Approval System:** Admins approve participants directly via a smart contract, ensuring every approval is recorded and transparent.
- **User Dashboard:** Attendees can browse and register for upcoming events with a simple, intuitive interface.
- **Secure & Unique QR Codes:** Upon approval, each participant receives a unique QR code for entry, preventing duplication and unauthorized access.
- **Built on Aptos:** Utilizes the speed, low cost, and security of the Aptos blockchain for a superior user experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Admin Flow

1. **Connect Wallet:** The admin connects their Aptos wallet (e.g., Petra).
2. **Initialize Registry:** On first use, the admin initializes the smart contract registry.
3. **Create Event:** The admin fills in event details (name, date, location, max participants) and publishes it to the blockchain.
4. **Approve Participants:** As users register, they appear in the admin's approval queue. The admin verifies and approves them, triggering an on-chain transaction.

### User Flow

1. **Connect Wallet:** An attendee connects their Aptos wallet.
2. **Browse Events:** They view the list of available events on their dashboard.
3. **Register:** They click "Register" for their desired event, submitting their wallet address for approval.
4. **Get Approved:** Once the admin approves their registration, their status is updated on-chain.
5. **Receive QR Code:** Upon approval, a unique, non-transferable QR code is generated, which serves as their ticket for entry.
